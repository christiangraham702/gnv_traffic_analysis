# High Delay Prediction Model Card

## Model Details
- Model Type: RandomForestClassifier
- Version: 1.0
- Date Created: 2025-04-22

## Model Parameters
{'bootstrap': True, 'ccp_alpha': 0.0, 'class_weight': None, 'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'max_leaf_nodes': None, 'max_samples': None, 'min_impurity_decrease': 0.0, 'min_samples_leaf': 2, 'min_samples_split': 5, 'min_weight_fraction_leaf': 0.0, 'monotonic_cst': None, 'n_estimators': 800, 'n_jobs': None, 'oob_score': False, 'random_state': 42, 'verbose': 0, 'warm_start': False}

## Performance Metrics

## Required Features
['Total_Vol', 'EW_Vol', 'NS_Vol', 'EW_to_NS', 'Green_EW', 'Green_to_Demand_EW', 'Ped_Load', 'Period_Numeric']

## Intended Use
- Primary intended uses: Predict high delay (>60 seconds) at traffic intersections
- Primary intended users: Traffic engineers, urban planners

## Data
- Training data: Intersection traffic data with engineered features
- Evaluation data: 20% validation split stratified by intersection

## Ethical Considerations
- The model is trained on a limited sample of intersections
- Predictions should be verified by traffic engineers before operational decisions
- Model does not include demographic or personally identifiable information

## Limitations
- Model is trained on data from specific intersections and may not generalize well to very different locations
- The training data may not capture all seasonal variations in traffic patterns
- External factors like construction, special events, or weather are not accounted for

## Caveats
- Predictions are probabilistic and should be used as guidance rather than absolute truth
- Model should be retrained periodically as traffic patterns change
