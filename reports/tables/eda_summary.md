# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the findings from the exploratory data analysis of traffic data.

## Key Visualizations
The following visualizations were generated during the EDA process:

- **intersection_feature_distributions.png**: Distributions of key features
- **link_feature_distributions.png**: Distributions of key features
- **features_vs_delay.png**: Analysis of delay factors
- **am_vs_pm_peak.png**: Comparison of peak traffic periods
- **features_by_delay_category.png**: Analysis of delay factors
- **intersection_correlation_matrix.png**: Correlation analysis between features
- **link_correlation_matrix.png**: Correlation analysis between features
- **metrics_by_period.png**: Temporal patterns in traffic data

## Key Tables
The following tables provide statistical summaries of the data:

- **intersection_feature_stats.md**: Summary statistics of key features
- **link_feature_stats.md**: Summary statistics of key features
- **high_delay_stats.md**: Statistics grouped by delay category
- **intersection_correlations.md**: Correlation matrix between features
- **link_correlations.md**: Correlation matrix between features
- **period_stats.md**: Statistics by time period

## Next Steps
Based on the exploratory analysis, the next steps should include:

1. Building a predictive model for intersection delay
2. Developing a random forest classifier to identify high-delay intersections
3. Performing feature importance analysis to understand key factors
4. Creating an interactive map visualization of the results
