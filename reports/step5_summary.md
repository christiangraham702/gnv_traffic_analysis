# Step 5: Modeling Pipeline Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the modeling process and results for predicting high delay at traffic intersections.
The modeling follows the exploratory data analysis completed in Step 4.

## Modeling Approach
The task was to build a classification model that predicts whether an intersection will experience high delay 
(>60 seconds per vehicle) based on traffic and signal timing features.

## Data Preparation
- Features selected from the engineered dataset
- Data split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets
- Stratified sampling by intersection to ensure each intersection is represented in both sets
- Required features are saved to ensure consistency in production

## Baseline Model: Decision Tree
A simple decision tree classifier was used as the baseline model.

### Baseline Model Metrics
- Accuracy: 1.0000
- Precision: 1.0000
- Recall: 1.0000
- F1 Score: 1.0000
- ROC-AUC: 1.0000
- Cross-Validation F1 (Mean): 0.7267
- Cross-Validation F1 (Std): 0.1665

## Improved Model: Random Forest
An optimized Random Forest classifier was developed using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.

### Hyperparameter Search
- n_estimators: [200, 400, 800]
- max_depth: [None, 6, 12, 18]
- min_samples_leaf: [1, 2, 3, 5]
- min_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]
- class_weight: [None, "balanced"]

### Improved Model Metrics
- Accuracy: 1.0000
- Precision: 1.0000
- Recall: 1.0000
- F1 Score: 1.0000
- ROC-AUC: 1.0000
- Cross-Validation F1 (Mean): 0.6600
- Cross-Validation F1 (Std): 0.0952

## Model Evaluation
- Cross-validation was used to assess model stability
- Confusion matrices were generated to visualize classification performance
- ROC curves were plotted to evaluate classifier thresholds
- Feature selection was explored to identify the most important variables

## Feature Importance Analysis
- Feature importance was calculated to identify the most influential features
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was performed to interpret model predictions
- Individual explanations were generated to understand specific prediction cases

## Model Persistence
- The best model has been saved as `models/high_delay_rf.pkl` for use in predictions
- A model card was created with detailed information about the model
- Required features were saved to ensure consistent prediction inputs

## Next Steps
The next step (Step 6) will focus on scenario generation and transfer learning:
1. Using link data to create synthetic scenarios
2. Predicting delay probabilities for these scenarios
3. Identifying conditions that lead to reduced delay
