# Step 6: Scenario Analysis Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the findings from the scenario generation and analysis process.
Synthetic scenarios were created based on link traffic patterns and evaluated for delay probability.

## Scenario Generation
- Total scenarios generated: 30
- Good scenarios (delay probability < 0.3): 28
- Bad scenarios (delay probability â‰¥ 0.3): 2

## Key Differences Between Good and Bad Scenarios
The following features showed the largest differences between good and bad scenarios:

| Feature | Good Scenario Avg | Bad Scenario Avg | % Difference |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Green_to_Demand_EW | 0.20 | 0.09 | 117.6% |
| EW_Vol | 256.13 | 690.89 | -62.9% |
| Total_Vol | 574.38 | 1117.83 | -48.6% |
| Ped_Load | 47.87 | 85.80 | -44.2% |
| EW_to_NS | 2.33 | 1.62 | 43.7% |

## Recommendations for Delay Reduction
- **Increase Green_to_Demand_EW**: Good scenarios have 117.6% higher values
- **Decrease EW_Vol**: Good scenarios have 62.9% lower values
- **Decrease Total_Vol**: Good scenarios have 48.6% lower values
- **Decrease Ped_Load**: Good scenarios have 44.2% lower values
- **Increase EW_to_NS**: Good scenarios have 43.7% higher values

## Next Steps
These findings will be incorporated into the final interactive dashboard to allow users to:
1. Explore the impact of different traffic and signal timing parameters
2. Test scenarios for specific intersections
3. Identify optimal configurations for minimizing delay
