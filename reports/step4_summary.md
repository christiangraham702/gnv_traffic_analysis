# Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the findings from exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the traffic datasets. 
The EDA follows the data cleaning and feature engineering completed in Steps 2 and 3.

## Data Dimensions
- Intersection dataset: Records of intersection traffic data with engineered features
- Link dataset: Records of link/segment traffic data with engineered features

## Key Findings - Intersection Data

### Distribution Analysis
- Total volume distribution shows the traffic load varies significantly across different intersections
- Delay distribution reveals congestion patterns with many intersections experiencing moderate to high delays
- East-West to North-South volume ratio demonstrates directionality of traffic flow
- Green time allocation shows how signals are currently configured to handle traffic demand

### Correlation Analysis
- Strong correlation between total volume and directional volumes (EW_Vol, NS_Vol)
- Moderate correlation between delay and traffic volumes
- Green time allocation shows some correlation with traffic volumes, indicating signal timing responds to demand
- Pedestrian load contributes to delay at some intersections

### Delay Classification
- A significant portion of intersection measurements show high delay (>60 seconds)
- High delay intersections typically have higher total volumes and pedestrian activity
- Green-to-demand ratio is typically lower for high delay intersections
- Time period analysis reveals differences in metrics between AM and PM periods

## Key Findings - Link Data

### Traffic Pattern Analysis
- Peak ratio distributions highlight directional traffic patterns throughout the day
- AM vs PM peak analysis shows most links have higher PM peaks than AM peaks
- Heavy vehicle percentage varies significantly across different links
- Directional balance indicates asymmetric flow on many roadway segments

### Correlation Insights
- Average Daily Traffic (ADT) correlates with both AM and PM peak volumes
- Heavy vehicle percentage shows inverse correlation with peak ratios
- Direction balance correlates with peak ratios, indicating balanced roads have more consistent traffic patterns

- Features by Delay Category boxplots (features_by_delay_category.png)
- AM vs PM Peak Ratio comparison (am_vs_pm_peak.png)

### Correlation Analysis
- Intersection Correlation Matrix (intersection_correlation_matrix.png)
- Link Correlation Matrix (link_correlation_matrix.png)

### Time Period Analysis
- Metrics by Period (AM/PM) (metrics_by_period.png)

## Key Insights for Modeling
1. Total volume and directional volumes are likely to be important predictors of delay
2. Time period (AM/PM) significantly affects traffic patterns and should be included in models
3. Green time allocation relative to demand may be critical for predicting high delay
4. Pedestrian clearance times contribute to delay and should be considered in the model
5. Imbalanced directional flows may require special consideration in the model

## Next Steps
The next step (Step 5) will focus on building predictive models:
1. Preparing train/validation splits for modeling
2. Building baseline classification model for delay prediction
3. Improving model performance with Random Forest
4. Evaluating models and analyzing feature importance
